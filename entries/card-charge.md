### It's a charge for my consulting services or book

**Who am I?** I'm Pete Keen, a software developer and author in Ann Arbor, MI.

**Why are you charging us?** This is either a one-time charge for my book, [Mastering Modern Payments: Using Stripe with Rails](https://www.masteringmodernpayments.com) or a one-time or subscription charge for consulting services.

**Can we get an invoice?** Every time I bill you I send you a complete invoice and receipt. For book sales this also includes your download link.

**Can we get a refund?** If you're unsatisified with your book purchase for any reason, reply to your invoice email and let me know. If you can't find your invoice email, contact me at [pete@petekeen.net](mailto:pete@petekeen.net) and I'll do my best to help. Consulting services are non-refundable.

**Any further questions?** Send me an email at [pete@petekeen.net](mailto:pete@petekeen.net) and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.
